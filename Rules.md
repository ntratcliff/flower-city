## Phases

Flower City has two phases: **Spring**, and **Summer**.

### Spring
Spring is the _growth_ phase. During the Spring, players take turns placing either a leaf or a stem on the plant, until all players have run out of pieces.

* Starting with the first player, take turns placing an **Offshoot Stem** or a **Leaf**.
	* **Offshoot Stems** may only be placed at the end of another **Offshoot Stem**, or at the joint between two **Central Stem** pieces. There may only be one **Offshoot** per **Central Stem** joint. 
	* **Leaves** may only be placed with one end at the joint between two **Offshoot Stems**, up to 2 per joint, one for each side.
* If all **Central Stem** joints are occupied, and not all **Central Stem** segments have been placed, you may add another **Central Stem** segment to the main stem. This does not count as a turn.
* Once all player pieces have been used, move to the **Summer** phase.


### Summer
Summer is the _development_ phase. During the Summer, players take turns maturing their **Leaves** by flipping them over, and scoring **Growth Points** by being the first to grow a **Flower** on an **Offshoot**.

* Starting with the first player, take turns maturing your **Leaves** by flipping one of them over each turn.
	* You can only mature your own **Leaves**.
* If, after you've matured your **Leaf**, the majority (more than half) of the leaves on the **Offshoot** are matured, the **Offshoot** is matured! Choose a **Small Flower** and put it in front of you. On your next turn, you must place the **Small Flower** on top of the matured **Offshoot**. Add 1 point to your **Score Card** for each **Offshoot Stem** and **Leaf** on the **Offshoot**. This uses your turn.
* Once a **Flower** is placed on an **Offshoot**, no more **Leaves** on that **Offshoot** may be matured. **Leaves** may be matured in the turn between an **Offshoot** maturing and the scoring player placing their **Flower**, but doing so has no effect on the score or scoring player for that **Offshoot**.
* You may not pass your turn. You may run out of moves to make, in which case your turn is skipped.
* Once all players have run out of moves, Summer--and the game--is over! The player with the most points wins, and may choose a **Large Flower** to place at the top of the **Central Stem**.

# Winning

Once all players have run out of moves in Summer, the game is over. The player with the highest score wins, and gets to complete the plant by picking and placing a **Large Flower** at the top of the **Central Stem**.
